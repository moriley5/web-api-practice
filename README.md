# TutorialsTeacher - ASP.NET Web API Tutorial

## Summary

I created this practice project in pursuit of learning ASP.NET Web API 2. I focused on configuration, parameter binding, and routing, using both convention-based and attribute routing methods.

For this project, I opted to use the Web API template, which adds the necessary folders and references for both MVC and Web API. I used the third party tools Fiddler and Postman for learning how to test Web API. Fiddler is a free debugging proxy for any browser, and Postman is a free API debugging tool.
